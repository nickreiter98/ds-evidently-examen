* Question 4: Through the three weeks, the model's performance is decreasing what can be derived from the MAE.
* Question 5: A potential conlusion for the drift might be that the data is varying over time.
* Question 6: The potential drift is caused by a data drift. The numerical values are weather features which are highly variable. In conclusion, this causes model drift!
